- Socket.io is a lib that contains an API for Websockets/NodeJS

- Websockets is an API that allows for persistent connections between clients
and servers

- Both parties can send/receive data until the connection is closed

--- HTTP vs. Websockets ---
- HTTP would be like if every time you or your friend wanted to
share information, you’d have to call each other and then hang up.
This is great if you just need to share something every once in a while.
This becomes rather tedious if the required frequency is much higher however.

- Websockets would be like if you or your friend still called each other,
but just didn’t hang up and left the line open until the project was done.

- File communication (Express)
  Client asks server for a file

- Package communication (Socket.io)
  Client sends data to server (Ex: Input)
  Server sends data to client (Ex. Player Position)

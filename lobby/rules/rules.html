  <h1>The Rules</h1>
  <p>All players deal cards in a clockwise fashion.
    Cards are dealt one at a time by the respective player.
    There are two major components to Egyptian Rat Screw: slapping and face-cards.
  </p>

  <h2>Slapping</h2>
  <h3>A slap is constituted in two ways: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When two of the same value cards are played in successive
      order.</li>

    <li>When a "sandwich" is played. A sandwich can only be one card thick and must have
      two of the same value cards surrounding another card of any value.</li>

    <li>Eliminated players (players without any cards left) can still slap the pot to
      earn cards and get back into the game, but slapping on an invalid pot three
      times eliminates the slapper from play entirely.</li>

    <li>Slapping on an invalid pot by a player with cards in their hand results in
      the "burning" of a card, where the failed slapper places a card from the top
      of their hand at the bottom of the pot which doesn't impact future slapping in
      any capacity.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Face-cards:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Upon playing a face-card, the next player has a certain number of chances to
      play a new face-card and keeps the pot in play.</li>
    <li>Jacks get one chance for another face-card to be played, Queens get two, Kings
      get three, and Aces get four. </li>
    <li> If the player fails to play a new face-card, the
      owner of the original face-card receives all the cards in the pot.</li>
    <li> Slaps are permitted during face-card play. </li>
  </ul>
